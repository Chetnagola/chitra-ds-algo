            // Logic of return statement:  When the length is an odd number, we can get rid of the middle digit by revertedNumber/10
            // For example when the input is 12321, at the end of the while loop we get x = 12, revertedNumber = 123,
            // since the middle digit doesn't matter in palidrome(it will always equal to itself), we can simply get rid of it.
